# Insights

## 1. Accuracy By Iterative Training
With training, the model improves its ability to recognize handwritten digits. This demonstrates how the backpropagation algorithm reduces classification errors with each iteration.

## 2. Feature Abstraction
The model learns increasingly complex features layer by layer, starting from simple edges and curves to abstract patterns that represent handwritten digits. This hierarchical learning showcases the power of convolutional layers in extracting meaningful representations.

## 3. Overfitting Risks
If the model is over-trained without regularization, it may memorize the training data, leading to poor generalization for unseen examples. A balance between model complexity and regularization is crucial for robustness.

# Model Functionality

The demo utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Key operations include:

- **Input Image Transformation**: The input is a 28x28 grayscale image, where each pixel is represented by an intensity value.
- **Feature Extraction**: Convolutional layers use filters to extract spatial hierarchies of features like edges and curves.
- **Pooling**: Subsampling layers reduce spatial dimensions while retaining critical information, lowering computational cost and mitigating overfitting.
- **Activation Functions**: Non-linear transformations (e.g., ReLU) enable the model to learn complex relationships.
- **Output Prediction**: Fully connected layers transform extracted features into class probabilities (digits 0-9) using the softmax function.

# Learned Features

### 1. Low-Level Features
The early convolutional layers extract edges, lines, and corners from the input image.

### 2. Mid-Level Features
Subsequent layers combine basic features to detect shapes and digit-like structures.

### 3. High-Level Features
Deeper layers encode full representations of digits, distinguishing subtle differences between similar digits like '8' and '3'.
